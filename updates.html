                    <p>March 2020: Nishant Gupta represented the team at the IEEE Aerospace conference 2020 held at Yellowstone, Montana, USA. Nishant is the telemetry subsystem lead and author of two out of three papers presented at the conference.
        The first paper describes the design procedure of an onboard and ground station telemetry architecture for a Cubesat. The second paper is primarily authored by Avishek Prasad, and details the interface architecture between the Telemetry and OBC subsystems. Lastly, Nishant presented a paper on behalf of other team members from ADCS. This paper investigates the instabilities in detumbling algorithms, which are used to lower the angular velocity of a satellite.<br>
